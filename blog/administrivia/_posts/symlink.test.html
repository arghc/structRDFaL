title: Symlink instead of moving files
---
<p>I don't know how all these Jekyllites can be obsessed with "pretty
  links" (ugh!) and don't care about these curs'd date-prefixed
  files.... 

  So much extra typing when linking or editing them.  I've fixed the
  linking part with the permalink incantation in
  the <code>_config.yml</code> with
  <code>permalink: "/:categories/:title:output_ext"</code>.  But
  there's still the extra typing part when you need to go in and
  fiddle after publishing.</p>
<p>This is a test to see if I can just symbolically link the file to a
  published filename without bolloxing up the works on the generated
  side</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Success!!  *Happy Dance!!*  Now, one only
  need deal with the date stuff in the file names at the moment of
  publication.</p>
