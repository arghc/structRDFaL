  <h2>Past and Present</h2>
  <p>The awkwardly named structRDFaL theme is a Jekyll theme primarily
    concerned with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/"
	title="The W3C on Web best practices">structured data</a>
    (apply your own style!). 
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data"
     title= "Google on structured data">SEO</a> is actually a
     secondary concern.
     The <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data#structured-data-format" 
	    title="Google on structured data formats">structured data
     format</a> I chose is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/"
     title="W3C on RDFa Lite">RDFa Lite</a> for its human readability
  and minimal repetition and coding requirements, unlike 
  <a href="https://json-ld.org/"
     title="JSON-LD Community Group on">JSON-LD</a> which essentially
     duplicates your page in the separated markup
     (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" 
	     title="Wikipedia on Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</a> at
  all) or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/"
	     title="W3C on microdata">microdata</a> where there
     are <em>so</em> many more full URLs in <code>itemtype</code>s and
     the like.</p>
  <aside align="center" style="border:black solid 2px;">On 
    <a href="https://github.com/arghc/structrdfal"
       title="GitHub repo">GitHub</a>,
    on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/structrdfal"
	  title="Gemmed theme">RubyGems</a></aside>
  <p>While not
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_standard"
	 title="Wikipedia on software standards">"true"
    standard</a>, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> is a de
    facto standard due to its pervasiveness and that it was created by
    agreement between the major search engines.  Hewing closer to the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/" 
       title="W3C on the Semantic Web">ideal of the semantic web</a>,  
    however, I have also included <a href="http://dublincore.org/"
      title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">Dublin Core</a>
    markup.</p>
  <p>Speaking of standards and best
    practices, <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5
      Boilerplate</a> was used as the initial basis.  Within the
    context of the theme, however, almost everything is optional.
    Defaults are inferred where they make sense and small
    complications are handled for you.  Bigger and more complicated
    things like the pricing structure for Events and internal Dublin
    Core markup are (at least in the first pass) left to you.</p>

  <h2>For the future</h2>
  <p>More Schemas, in particular I have implemented the HowTo set for
    a different site I'm working on.  Also Review, Book,
    CollectionPage (ImageGallery).</p>
  <p>Implement breadcrumbs</p>
  <p>Responsiveness is clearly missing.  Sorry I did not design for
    mobile first.</p>
  <p>Late to the party, I am just
    learning <a href="https://sass-lang.com/"
		title="Syntactically awesome style sheets">SASS</a>
    now (I was waiting to see which CSS preprocessor would win!
    <span title="sheepish grin">(๑´ㅂ`๑ )</span>), but I can see where
    it would make certain things easier and more flexible.</p>
